This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## For Development

If you'd like to checkout the project before deployment OR you are working on it with me, here are the installation dependencies:
+ React ( npm install react )
+ Supabase ( npm install @supabase/supabase-js )
+ Embla Carousel ( npm install embla-carousel-react )


## Getting Started

I'm working with npm. Run the project with:

npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Api

Since the project hasn't been deployed yet, the api requests are socketed to a single IP (mine lol). Feel free to contact me if you want a cr api pipeline
